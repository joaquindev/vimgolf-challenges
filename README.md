vimgolf-challenges
==================

Inspiration of this repo comes from this noble initiative: [dandorman/vimgolfdigest][url-repo-source]

A repo storing all data about the vimgolf challenges that I do, because as they say in www.vimgolf.com "Real Vim ninjas count every keystroke - do you?"

Remember vimgolf simple and minimal use: 

```
$gem install vimgolf
$vimgolf setup
```

And once you get it all configured, just choose your challenge:

```
vimgolf put <challenge-number>
```
